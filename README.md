# deuces-wild-poker-game
This is the code used to create a Deuces Wild Poker casino game using ActionScript3 and Flash.
I personally was Project Leader of a three-person team to create a simple framework for a Deuces Wild Poker game. I was in charge of managing the team and workload between each member. I also was in charge of writing some of the code and debugging it when necessary.
This repository shows a sample of some of the relevant code used to create the game.
